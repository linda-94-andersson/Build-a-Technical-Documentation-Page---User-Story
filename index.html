            <ol>
                <li> Wrap each piece of beef tightly in a triple layer of cling film to set its shape, then chill overnight.
                </li> <br>
                <li> Remove the cling film, then quickly sear the beef fillets in a hot pan with a little olive oil for
                    <code>30-60 seconds</code> until browned all over and rare in the middle. Remove from the pan and leave
                    to cool.</li><br>
                <li> Finely chop the mushrooms and fry in a hot pan with a little olive oil, the thyme leaves and some
                    seasoning. When the mushrooms begin to release their juices, continue to cook over a high heat for about
                    <code>10 minutes</code> until all the excess moisture has evaporated and you are left with a mushroom
                    paste (known as a duxelle). Remove the duxelle from the pan and leave to cool.</li>

            <p>
            <ol>
                <li> Mix the flour and salt together in a large bowl or in the bowl of a stand mixer that is fitted with a
                    dough hook. Gradually stir in water until the dough holds together enough to clean the sides of the
                    bowl. You may not need the full amount of water. Shape into a flat ball, and allow to rest for at least
                    <code>10 minutes.</code></li> <br>
                <li> Place the butter between two pieces of plastic wrap and pound into a flat disc using a rolling pin or
                    other heavy object. Refrigerate until firm, about <code>20 minutes.</code></li><br>
                <li> On a lightly floured surface, roll out the dough into a large rectangle about <code>1/2 inch</code>
                    thick. Place the disc of chilled butter in the center and fold the two ends over it so that it is
                    completely encased in dough. Roll out the dough again, taking care not to let the butter break through
                    the dough, to about 1/2 inch thickness. Fold into thirds. This is the first ''turn''. Rotate the dough
                    <code>90 degrees</code> and roll out into a rectangle again. Fold into thirds. By this time the butter
                    is starting to warm up. Place the dough on a baking sheet and mark it with two pokes from your finger
                    (two turns). Wrap in plastic and refrigerate for at least <code>30 minutes.</code></li><br>
                <li> Repeat this rolling, folding and turning two more times, then refrigerate until firm. Repeat two more
                    times for a total of 6 ''turns''. Wrap and refrigerate. The dough is now ready to roll out and use in
                    any recipe calling for puff pastry. Roll the dough out as thin as 1/4 inch to make pastries. Bake in a
                    preheated oven of at least <code>400 degrees F (200 degrees C)</code> to get the maximum puff from your
                    pastry.</li>

            <p>
            <ol>
                <li> Cut the pastry in half, place on a lightly floured surface and roll each piece into a rectangle large
                    enough to envelop one of the beef fillets. Chill in the refrigerator.</li> <br>
                <li> Lay a large sheet of cling film on a work surface and place <code>4 slices of Parma ham</code> in the
                    middle, overlapping them slightly, to create a square. Spread half the duxelle evenly over the ham.</li>
                <br>
                <li> Season the beef fillets, then place them on top of the mushroom-covered ham. Using the cling film, roll
                    the Parma ham over the beef, then roll and tie the cling film to get a nice, evenly thick log. Repeat
                    this step with the other beef fillet, then chill for at least <code>30 minutes.</code></li> <br>
                <li> Brush the pastry with the egg wash. Remove the cling film from the beef, then wrap the pastry around
                    each ham-wrapped fillet. Trim the pastry and brush all over with the egg wash. Cover with cling film and
                    chill for at least <code>30 minutes.</code></li>

            <ol>
                <li> Meanwhile, make the red wine sauce. Heat the oil in a large pan, then fry the beef trimmings for a few
                    minutes until browned on all sides. Stir in the shallots with the peppercorns, bay and thyme and
                    continue to cook for about <code>5 minutes,</code> stirring frequently, until the shallots turn golden
                    brown.</li> <br>
                <li> Pour in the vinegar and let it bubble for a few minutes until almost dry. Now add the wine and boil
                    until almost completely reduced. Add the stock and bring to the boil again. Lower the heat and simmer
                    gently for <code>1 hour,</code> removing any scum from the surface of the sauce, until you have the
                    desired consistency. Strain the liquid through a fine sieve lined with muslin. Check for seasoning and
                    set aside.</li>

            <ol>
                <li> When you are ready to cook the beef wellingtons, score the pastry lightly and brush with the egg wash
                    again, then bake at <code>200°C/Gas 6 for 15-20 minutes</code> until the pastry is golden brown and
                    cooked. Rest for <code>10 minutes</code> before carving.</li> <br>
                <li> Meanwhile, reheat the sauce. Serve the beef wellingtons sliced, with the sauce as an accompaniment.
